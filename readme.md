## Javascript algorhitmic challenges #2
first exercise of my 100 chalenges in 30 days!!
* A salesman has a number of cities to visit. They want to calculate the total number of possible paths they could take, visiting each city once before returning home. Return the total number of possible paths a salesman can travel, given n cities.

* If we have cities A, B and C, possible paths would be:
```
A -> B -> C
A -> C -> B
B -> A -> C
B -> C -> A
C -> B -> A
C -> A -> B

```

* first : install nodeJS for your os from https://nodejs.org/en/download/ and type in terminal or cmd 'node script.js'
